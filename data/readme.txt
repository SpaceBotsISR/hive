TR1
ENV1

vivebag_2019-02-11-15-45-40.bag - contains data of the tracker in a static state, using two lighthouses on tripods doing approximately a 90deg angle between their FOV. modes b and c. See attached picture.
For visual support see IMG_T1.jpg and IMG_ENV1.jpg

vivebag_2019-02-11-16-02-12.bag - contains data of the tracker initially in a static state using two lighthouses on tripods. After 30 seconds we start moving the trackers trying to copy the movement of astrobee, but slightly faster. The environment setup was the same as before. The orientation of the tracker didn't change very much during these.

vivebag_2019-02-11-16-07-37.bag - same but mostly the orientation changed during while the data was recorded.

vivebag_2019-02-11-16-10-06.bag - both linear movement and angular movement with the same environment.

ENV2

vivebag_2019-02-11-16-16-56.bag - New environment (see picture IMG_ENV2.jpg). For this dataset, the tracker was stationary in the sofa.

vivebag_2019-02-11-16-20-15.bag - same environment, but moved the tracker in circles around myself.

vivebag_2019-02-11-16-30-50.bag - the same but not just circles

vivebag_2019-02-11-16-32-48.bag - the same but now moved around the sofa instead of being always standing in the same place

ENV3

vivebeta1.bag - tilted the controllers up and down in the same position

vivebeta2.bag - the same but sideways

vivebeta3.bag - moved the tracker further aways and closer to the lighthouse

vivebeta4.bag - rotated the tracker around sensor 6's normals vector

vivebeta5.bag - tried to collect a bag with all positions and orientations to train model of the beta angle

vivebeta6.bag - big set of data collected with two lighthouses and moving the tracker arround the MoCap System

vivebeta7.bag - smaller set of the same environment (for testing)
